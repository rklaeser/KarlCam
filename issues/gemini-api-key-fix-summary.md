# Gemini API Key Fix - Status Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-17  
**Issue:** Staging API was missing GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

## Problem
The staging API at `https://api.staging.karl.cam` was missing the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable, while the pipeline job had it configured correctly. This prevented on-demand Gemini analysis from working.

## Solution Applied
Added the missing `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable to the API service configuration:
- **File:** `terraform/cloud-run.tf` lines 44-52
- **Change:** Added env block to read Gemini API key from Secret Manager
- **Deployment:** Successfully applied via `terraform apply` to staging environment

## Current Status

### ✅ Working
- API service now has `GEMINI_API_KEY` configured
- On-demand Gemini analysis is working via `/api/public/cameras/{id}/latest` endpoint
- **Verified cameras:**
  - `fogcam`: Returns `fog_score: 20`, `fog_level: "Light Fog"`, `confidence: 0.8`
  - `pacifica-pier`: Returns `fog_score: 20`, `fog_level: "Light Fog"`, `confidence: 0.75`

### ⚠️ Known Issues
- `marina-district` camera returns "Internal server error" (separate issue)
- `/api/stats` and `/api/config/full` endpoints return internal server errors (separate issues)

## Technical Details

### How It Works
1. The `/api/public/cameras/{camera_id}/latest` endpoint uses `OnDemandService`
2. If cached data is older than 30 minutes, it triggers fresh analysis
3. `GeminiService` analyzes the image using the newly available API key
4. Results are returned immediately with fog analysis

### Test Commands
```bash
# Test working cameras
curl https://api.staging.karl.cam/api/public/cameras/fogcam/latest
curl https://api.staging.karl.cam/api/public/cameras/pacifica-pier/latest

# Test API health
curl https://api.staging.karl.cam/health
```

## Next Steps
- ✅ Gemini integration is working - no further action needed for this issue
- Consider investigating the internal server errors on other endpoints if needed
- The fix is ready for production deployment when needed
