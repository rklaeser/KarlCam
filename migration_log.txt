KarlCam PostgreSQL → Firestore Migration (Staging + Production)
======================================================================

Databases to migrate:
  ✓ Staging: localhost:5432/karlcam_staging
  ✓ Production: localhost:5432/karlcam_production

This will migrate ALL data from both databases into a single Firestore instance.
This consolidates staging and production data together.
